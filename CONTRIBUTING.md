   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Chun-Huan-Lee/workflowiq.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

6. **Start development environment**

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that follow this pattern:

- `feature/description` - For new features
- `fix/description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/description` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - For code refactoring
- `test/description` - For adding tests

**Examples:**
- `feature/ai-process-discovery`
- `fix/authentication-redirect`
- `docs/api-endpoints`

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run tests** to ensure nothing is broken
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add AI-powered process discovery"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** with our template

## üéØ Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Follow ESLint** configuration
- **Use meaningful variable names** that describe their purpose
- **Write JSDoc comments** for functions and classes
- **Prefer functional programming** patterns where appropriate

```typescript
// Good
const calculateProcessEfficiency = (startTime: Date, endTime: Date): number => {
  return (endTime.getTime() - startTime.getTime()) / 1000;
};

// Bad
const calc = (a: any, b: any) => {
  return (b - a) / 1000;
};
```

### React Components

- **Use functional components** with hooks
- **Follow the component naming convention**: PascalCase
- **Keep components small** and focused on single responsibility
- **Use TypeScript interfaces** for props
- **Write meaningful prop names**

```tsx
// Good
interface ProcessCardProps {
  processId: string;
  title: string;
  efficiency: number;
  onEdit: (id: string) => void;
}

const ProcessCard: React.FC<ProcessCardProps> = ({ 
  processId, 
  title, 
  efficiency, 
  onEdit 
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Backend API

- **Use Express.js** with TypeScript
- **Follow RESTful** API conventions
- **Use proper HTTP status codes**
- **Implement error handling** middleware
- **Add request validation** using Joi or similar

```typescript
// Good
router.get('/api/processes/:id', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const process = await processService.getById(id);
    
    if (!process) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Process not found' });
    }
    
    res.json(process);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

### Database

- **Use Prisma** for database operations
- **Write meaningful migration names**
- **Include proper indexes** for performance
- **Use transactions** for related operations

### Testing

- **Write unit tests** for business logic
- **Write integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Use React Testing Library** for component tests
- **Aim for good test coverage** (70%+ is ideal)

```typescript
// Good test example
describe('ProcessService', () => {
  it('should calculate efficiency correctly', () => {
    const startTime = new Date('2024-01-01T09:00:00Z');
    const endTime = new Date('2024-01-01T10:00:00Z');
    
    const efficiency = calculateProcessEfficiency(startTime, endTime);
    
    expect(efficiency).toBe(3600); // 1 hour in seconds
  });
});
```
